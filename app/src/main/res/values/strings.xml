    <string name="AB_Banner">Attitude and Behavior</string>
    <string name="AB_title1">Dealing with Drivers Going the Wrong Way</string>
    <string name="AB_point1">On roads without a center divider, always watch out for vehicles that might suddenly move into your lane. Stay on the outer lane and drive at a safe speed.</string>
    <string name="AB_point2">If a driver is coming towards you in the wrong direction (counterflow):</string>
    <string name="AB_point2_1">Stay calm.</string>
    <string name="AB_point2_2">Don’t insist on having the right of way.</string>
    <string name="AB_point2_3">Signal early and switch lanes safely.</string>
    <string name="AB_point2_4">Avoid making eye contact to keep things from getting tense.</string>
    <string name="AB_point3">To avoid a collision if a vehicle moves toward you:</string>
    <string name="AB_point3_1">Look ahead and understand the road situation.</string>
    <string name="AB_point3_2">Steer to the right.</string>
    <string name="AB_point3_3">Slow down.</string>
    <string name="AB_point3_4">If needed, move off the road safely.</string>
    <string name="AB_point4">If you’re forced to ride off the road and can’t avoid hitting something:</string>
    <string name="AB_point4_1">Aim for something soft like bushes or plastic barriers.</string>
    <string name="AB_point4_2">If you must hit something fixed like a fence, try to hit it at an angle—not head-on—to reduce damage.</string>

    <string name="AB_title2">Dealing with Large or Long Vehicles</string>
    <string name="AB_point5">Give extra space when driving near big vehicles like trucks or buses. Be careful when passing them—only overtake if there\'s enough time and distance to do it safely.</string>
    <string name="AB_point6">When driving uphill or stopping behind a large vehicle, leave more space. It might roll back a little when the driver lets go of the brake or clutch.</string>
    <string name="AB_point7">Important Reminders:</string>
    <string name="AB_point7_1">Don’t overtake a large truck while it’s turning left or right.</string>
    <string name="AB_point7_2">These vehicles may take up more than one lane when turning.</string>
    <string name="AB_point7_3">Stay alert—they can block part or all of the road while making a turn.</string>

    <string name="Emergency_banner">Dealing with Emergency Situations</string>
    <string name="Emergency_brake">Emergency Braking</string>
    <string name="Emergency_brake_point1">If your brakes fail, stay calm and follow these steps:</string>
    <string name="Emergency_brake_point1_1">Pump the brake pedal quickly to build pressure (Warning: Do NOT pump if your car has ABS).</string>
    <string name="Emergency_brake_point1_2">Shift to a lower gear to help slow the car down.</string>
    <string name="Emergency_brake_point1_3">Use your horn and flash your lights to warn others.</string>
    <string name="Emergency_brake_point1_4">Gently use the parking brake on and off to slow down.</string>

    <string name="Skidding">Skidding</string>
    <string name="Skidding_point1">Skids usually happen when turning or stopping too fast on slippery or sloped roads (like when it’s wet or sandy).</string>
    <string name="Skidding_point2">If your car starts to skid:</string>
    <string name="Skidding_point2_1">Avoid braking if you can.</string>
    <string name="Skidding_point2_2">Lift your foot off the gas pedal.</string>
    <string name="Skidding_point2_3">Look where you want to go and gently steer in that direction.</string>
    <string name="Skidding_point2_4">Straighten the wheels once you regain control.</string>

    <string name="Collision_question">Question: Who goes first?</string>
    <string name="Collision_intro_point">Most accidents at intersections happen because drivers don’t follow right-of-way rules. Here\'s what to remember:</string>
    <string name="Collision_point1">🚦 No Signs or Traffic Lights</string>
    <string name="Collision_point1_1">Let the vehicle on your right go first.</string>
    <string name="Collision_point2">🛑 Stop Sign</string>
    <string name="Collision_point2_1">Come to a full stop.</string>
    <string name="Collision_point2_2">Yield to vehicles already in or near the intersection.</string>
    <string name="Collision_point2_3">If you stop at the same time as another car, the one on the right goes first.</string>
    <string name="Collision_point2_4">❌ Don’t do a rolling stop.</string>

    <string name="Collision_point3">⚠️ Give Way / Yield Sign</string>
    <string name="Collision_point3_1">Slow down and be ready to stop.</string>
    <string name="Collision_point3_2">Let other vehicles in or near the intersection go first.</string>

    <string name="Collision_point4">🚥 With Traffic Lights</string>
    <string name="Collision_point4_1">Green light? You can go, but yield to cars and pedestrians already crossing.</string>
    <string name="Collision_point4_2">Turning right on red? Stop completely first. Yield to people and traffic before turning.</string>
    <string name="Collision_point4_3">❌ Again, no rolling stops.</string>
